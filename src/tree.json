  "name": "Which type of access is more important in your case?",
  "info": "Is your primary need from a database to quickly find specific pieces of data (\"Fast Lookups\") or to perform detailed and intricate searches across your data (\"Complex Queries\")? <br><br> If \"Fast Lookups\" are more important, you're focused on getting specific data quickly, like retrieving a user profile by ID. This is crucial for applications needing rapid responses, like online shopping carts. If \"Complex Queries\" are more important, you need to run detailed searches and analyze large sets of data, such as generating reports or finding patterns, which is essential for tasks like business analytics or data mining.",

      "info": "If your database is roughly the \"Size of RAM\", it means all your data can fit into your computer's memory (RAM), which allows for very fast data access. The RAM of a normal computer is between 8GB and 64GB, but larger servers could even have a little more. This is ideal for small to medium-sized applications, like a personal project or a small business app. On the other hand, if your database is \"Really big\", it means your data far exceeds the size of your computer's memory, requiring special database systems designed to handle large amounts of data stored on disk or across multiple servers, which is common in big companies or services dealing with massive amounts of information.",
